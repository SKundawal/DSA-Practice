Imagine there are n points along a straight trail, while a runner run sprints of intervals between those point.
The training plan is an array a[], which implies the runner should run from point a[i] to point a[i+1].

For example, given n = 10, a = [2, 4, 1, 2].
The runner should run from point 2 to point 4,
then turn back from point 4 to point 1,
and then from point 1 to point 2.

Find the point that visited the most by runner after he finished training, i.e. in above example, point 2 is the most visited.
If more than one point are visited the most, find the point with minimum index.
